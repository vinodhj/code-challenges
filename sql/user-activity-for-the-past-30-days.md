Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

## Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+ 
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+ 
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+ 
## Explanation: Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.

## NOTE: MySQL DATE_SUB() Function
    - `SELECT DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 1 MONTH)`
    - `SELECT DATE('2019-07-27', '-1 MONTH')`

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
with temp as(
    select activity_date as day, user_id as active_users 
    from Activity
    where activity_date > (SELECT DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 1 MONTH)) and 
    activity_date <= '2019-07-27'
ORDER BY activity_date asc
)

select day, count(distinct active_users) as active_users  from temp
group by day
